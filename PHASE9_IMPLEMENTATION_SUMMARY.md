}) => api.post<PlayerAvailability>(`/teams/${teamId}/availability`, data);

// Get team availability for a specific week
export const getTeamAvailability = (teamId: number, weekNumber: number, leagueId: number) => {
  return api.get<WeekAvailability>(`/teams/${teamId}/availability/week/${weekNumber}?league_id=${leagueId}`);
};

## Backend API Endpoints Required

The components expect these backend endpoints to be available:

2. `GET /leagues/:leagueId/available-weeks` - Get available weeks for league
3. `POST /teams/:teamId/availability` - Submit player availability
4. `GET /teams/:teamId/availability/week/:weekNumber?league_id=:leagueId` - Get team availability
5. `PUT /teams/:teamId/availability/:availabilityId` - Update player availability
6. `GET /captain/team/:teamId/dashboard?league_id=:leagueId` - Get team dashboard data

## Usage

### PlayerAvailabilityForm
```tsx
import PlayerAvailabilityForm from './components/PlayerAvailabilityForm';

// Use in routing or as a page component
<PlayerAvailabilityForm />
```

### PlayerTeamView
```tsx
import PlayerTeamView from './components/PlayerTeamView';

// Use in routing or as a page component
<PlayerTeamView />
```
